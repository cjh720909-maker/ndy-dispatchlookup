# Logistics App Project Rules

## 1. Project Context
- **Name**: ndy-dispatchlookup
- **Framework**: Next.js (App Router), TypeScript
- **Database**: 
  - **Auth/Settlement**: PostgreSQL (Production) / SQLite (Local)
  - **Logistics**: MySQL (Legacy system, Read-only permissions for existing tables)
- **Primary Objective**: Manage vehicle dispatches and settlement reports for outsourced drivers.

## 2. Technical Principles
- Always use **Korean** for descriptions, comments, and user-facing messages.
- For MySQL data, handle **EUC-KR** encoding properly using `iconv-lite`.
- When modifying schemas, prioritize adding new tables to the **Auth/Settlement DB** (PostgreSQL/SQLite) as the user has limited permissions on the legacy MySQL DB.
- Use **Server Actions** for data fetching and mutations.
- **Database Synchronization Safety**: Since multiple projects share the same database, ALWAYS run `npx prisma db pull` before `npx prisma db push` to ensure the local schema reflects the latest remote state and avoid accidental table deletions.

## 3. Communication
- Acknowledge that this project is already cloned in `/home/red/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/ndy-dispatchlookup`.
- If the project is opened in a new session, verify the DB connection and run dev server immediately.
